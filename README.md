# Bradley_2023_CK2
Scripts and data for the CK2 substrate quality manuscript. Almost all scripts are written in R code and provided in the format of an R markdown file (.Rmd).
The scripts are organised with respect to their corresponding figures / supplementary figures. There is sufficient code and data here to reproduce almost all
analysis in the manuscript. I have not uploaded large input files (>25 MB) that can be obtained from an external source e.g. a supplementary table from a different paper.

Contents are as follows:

- Figure 1: Figure 1 and supplementary figures 2, 3 and 4
- Figure 2: Figure 2 and supplementary figures 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10
- Figure 3: Figure 3 and supplementary figure 11
- Figure 4: Figure 4 and supplementary figure 12.

Supplementary figures 1 and 5 are fairly self-contained and so have independent folders:

- Figure_S1: Supplementary figure 1
- Figure S5: Supplementary figure 5
