# Bradley_2023_CK2
Scripts and data for the CK2 substrate quality manuscript. Almost all scripts are written in R code and provided in the format of an R markdown file (.Rmd).
The scripts are organised with respect to their corresponding figures / supplementary figures. There is sufficient code and data here to reproduce almost all
analysis in the manuscript. I have not uploaded large input files (>25 MB) that can be obtained from an external source e.g. a supplementary table from a different paper.
The script for supplementary figure 7 is in the directory for Figure 4.
